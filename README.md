# Hi there, I'm Joona! 👋

This is a GitHub profile of a passionate developer from Finland who is interested in web development, data management & analysis, and AI. Currently, I'm working on several exciting projects (e.g. on a grading tool on LUT University's software department) with an open mind to learn more! I also love UNIX and Linux-based servers, containerization, and load balancing!

## Skills 🛠️

My main area of expertise comes from web development. I'm pretty keen on SaaS solutions, having worked with such projects in the past, but I also have experience on data structures and algorithms.

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C, Java, HTML, CSS...
- **Technologies:** React, Node.js, Flask, MongoDB, Express.js, RESTful, Socket.IO
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, VS Code, Postman, React dev-tools

## Cool Projects 🧑‍💻

During my software engineering career, I have been part of many awesome projects. Unfortunately, most of the work is proprietary software. However, here are a couple of projects I’m proud of:
